# React Native Employee Manager App
> The goal of this project is to minimize the responsibilities of every component. Fitting with the 'pure function' paradigms, we will extract component logic into Redux. It also explores view-to-view navigation in React Native.

`Why?` React is the **V**iew Layer in MVC, so it should only be responsible for taking logic and rendering it.

## Installation
``` bash
$ npm install
```

## Run-time
``` bash
$ react-native run-android
```
